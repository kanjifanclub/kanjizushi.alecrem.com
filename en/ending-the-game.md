# Ending Your Game and Scoring

- Each player's score is the sum of strokes for all kanji they completed

![Scoring]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link assets/en/kanjizushi-diagram-9-scoring.png %})

- The player with the highest score wins the game
- If two or more players are tied for the first place, the player with the single kanji with the highest stroke count is the winner
- If two or more players are still tied, the game is a tie
