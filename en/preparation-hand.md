# Starting your Game

- Choose a player at random to be the active player
- The active player shuffles the _shari_ deck, and puts it on the table face down
- The active player takes the top 6 cards from the _shari_ deck and lays them down on the table in two rows, face up

- Each player shuffles their own _neta_ deck, and puts it on the table face down
- Each player draws 5 cards from their own _neta_ deck â€” this will constitute their starting hand
- The active player starts a turn
