# Playing Your Turn (1)

- The active player completes a kanji using 1 _neta_ card from their hand and 1 _shari_ card on the table
- If the kanji is not within the 2,136 regular-use characters, both cards are put back and the turn ends

- If the kanji is a regular-use character, the active player puts both cards in front of themselves, face up
